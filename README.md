# Hello, I am Uƒüur Can üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

I am a Computer Engineer. I graduated from Aydƒ±n Adnan Menderes University. My department was Computer Engineering. I am currently a Master of Computer Engineering student at Izmir Institute of Technology. I live in Aydƒ±n. I'm interested in artificial intelligence sub-branches.

*My love of mathematics drove me towards computer engineering. I met data science thanks to my undergraduate education. I take firm steps forward in this wide-ranging journey, even if it is small.*
